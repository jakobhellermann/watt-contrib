# watt-contrib

A collection of proc-macro crates compiled to use [watt](https://github.com/dtolnay/watt).
This has the advantage, that their only dependency is the `watt` crate, saving compile time over compiling `syn`, `quote` etc.

They were generated using [cargo watt](https://github.com/jakobhellermann/cargo-watt).
